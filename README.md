AI Intern Task - PDF Summarization

PDF Processing Pipeline: A Domain-Specific Approach

1. Introduction 
Hello! I'm Prapanj KM, and I'm excited to present my solution for the Domain-Specific PDF Summarization and Keyword Extraction Pipeline. This project challenged me to think creatively and push the boundaries of what's possible with custom NLP solutions.

2. Problem Overview 

The task was to create a pipeline that could:

Process multiple PDFs concurrently
Generate domain-specific summaries
Extract relevant keywords
Store results in MongoDB
Handle documents of varying lengths efficiently

The catch? We needed to minimize the use of pre-built libraries to showcase our problem-solving skills.

3. Solution Architecture 

My solution revolves around five key components:

Concurrent PDF Processing: Leveraging Python's multiprocessing to handle multiple documents simultaneously.
Custom Summarization Algorithm: A frequency-based approach that adapts to document length.
Bespoke TF-IDF Implementation: For keyword extraction without relying on external libraries.
Domain-Specific Processing: A flexible system for tailoring results to specific fields.
Robust Error Handling and Reporting: Ensuring smooth operation and insightful performance metrics.

Deep Dive: Custom Algorithms (1 minute 30 seconds)
Let's look at two core algorithms I developed:

4. Adaptive Summarization:

Analyzes word frequency across the document
Scores sentences based on the importance of their words
Adjusts summary length based on document category (short, medium, long)
Result: Concise, relevant summaries tailored to document size


5. Custom TF-IDF for Keyword Extraction:

Calculates term frequency and inverse document frequency from scratch
Implements efficient scoring mechanism for word importance
Avoids common words and focuses on domain-relevant terms
Outcome: Precise, context-aware keyword identification



6. Scalability and Performance
   
To ensure the pipeline can handle large volumes efficiently:

Implemented multiprocessing for parallel document processing
Designed memory-efficient text processing algorithms
Created a comprehensive performance reporting system
Result: Scalable solution capable of processing extensive document sets

7. Domain-Specific Innovation 

The pipeline's flexibility shines in its domain-specific processing:

Customizable keyword prioritization based on domain
Extendable framework for incorporating domain-specific rules
Potential for integration with machine learning models for enhanced domain understanding

8. Error Handling and Robustness
   
Reliability was a key focus:

Implemented thorough error logging and recovery mechanisms
Designed the system to gracefully handle corrupted PDFs or network issues
Created detailed performance reports for system monitoring and optimization

9. Conclusion and Future Enhancements
    
This project showcases my ability to develop custom, efficient NLP solutions. Looking ahead, I'm excited about:

Integrating more advanced NLP techniques
Expanding domain-specific capabilities
Optimizing for even larger scale processing
